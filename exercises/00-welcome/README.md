## ðŸ’¬ Understanding the OWASP Top 10

The **OWASP Top 10** is a list of the most critical security vulnerabilities in web applications, compiled by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP). Each vulnerability on this list represents a significant security risk to applications and can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or compromise the integrity of the application. Hereâ€™s why understanding and addressing these vulnerabilities is crucial:

### **The OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities are:**

1. **Broken Access Control (A01:2021)**: Flaws in access control allowing users to access unauthorized resources.
2. **Cryptographic Failures (A02:2021)**: Failures in cryptography that can lead to the exposure of sensitive data.
3. **Injection (A03:2021)**: Malicious code injection through unvalidated inputs, such as SQL Injection.
4. **Insecure Design (A04:2021)**: Security design deficiencies that can be exploited.
5. **Security Misconfiguration (A05:2021)**: Incorrect security configurations that attackers can exploit.
6. **Vulnerable and Outdated Components (A06:2021)**: The use of vulnerable or outdated components that pose security risks.
7. **Identification and Authentication Failures (A07:2021)**: Flaws in user identification and authentication that can allow unauthorized access.
8. **Software and Data Integrity Failures (A08:2021)**: Lack of verification of software and data integrity, affecting their reliability.
9. **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (A09:2021)**: Insufficient logging and monitoring of security events, making it harder to detect incidents.
10. **Server-Side Request Forgery (A10:2021)**: Exploiting server-side request manipulation to access unauthorized internal resources.

In this exercise, we will explore how each of these vulnerabilities can be identified and exploited in a controlled environment.
